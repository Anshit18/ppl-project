# Coin flip model with observations
# This example models flipping a biased coin

# Prior for the coin bias
p = 0.7  # We believe the coin has a 70% chance of landing heads

# Simulate coin flips and observe outcomes
observe(1, bernoulli(p))  # We observed heads (1)
observe(1, bernoulli(p))  # We observed heads (1)
observe(0, bernoulli(p))  # We observed tails (0)
observe(1, bernoulli(p))  # We observed heads (1)

# Sample a prediction for the next flip
next_flip = sample(bernoulli(p))
